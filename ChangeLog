	* Release 1.1 built.

	* Can run as a systemd service.

	* Uses a config file for options, allowing to tune service behavior
	  without updating the service file. File is by default
	    /usr/local/etc/mapper-devusb.conf

	* Installer now creates user mapper-devusb that'll run the service.

	* Installer creates directory /var/log/mapper-devusb where the file
	  activity.log is mapper-devusb program log file.

	* Normally (NOT TESTED), relies on autotools variables so that if the
	  executable is installed in a different directory (different from the
	  default /usr/local/bin), the service file gets updated accordingly, and
	  *gracefully*.
